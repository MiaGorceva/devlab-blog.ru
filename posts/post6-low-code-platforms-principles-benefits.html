            <section>

              <p>
                The world of software development is changing rapidly – and low-code technologies are becoming
                a major engine of this transformation. Low-code makes it possible to build both simple and quite
                complex applications with minimal manual coding. According to forecasts, by the end of 2025 more
                than <strong>70% of new business applications</strong> will be created using low-code tools.
              </p>

              <h2>Why Low-Code Is Becoming So Important</h2>
              <p>
                The rise of accessible technology platforms has made it possible to create digital products
                even for those who do not have a deep technical background. Low-code <strong>democratises
                development</strong>, opening the door to innovation for both professional developers and
                business users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Such platforms simplify access to modern automation tools, speed up delivery and allow teams
                to focus on <strong>business logic instead of technical plumbing</strong>.
              </p>

              <h2>Core Principles of Low-Code Platforms</h2>
              <p>
                Low-code approaches to building software products rely on several key principles:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Visual development</strong> – applications are designed through an interface with
                  drag-and-drop components rather than handwritten code only.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Abstraction of technical details</strong> – the need for deep programming is minimised
                  for many standard scenarios.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reuse of components</strong> – standard blocks can be used across multiple projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Rapid prototyping and iteration</strong> – faster development and testing cycles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cross-platform delivery</strong> – the ability to target web, mobile and sometimes
                  desktop with the same model.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Flexibility and scalability</strong> – support for growth of the project without
                  rewriting the architecture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Integration capabilities</strong> – easy connection to databases, APIs and third-party
                  services.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Benefits of Low-Code for Your Organisation</h2>

              <h3>Fast time-to-market</h3>
              <p>
                Thanks to visual interfaces and ready-made modules, new solutions can be built several times
                faster than with traditional stacks. For many teams this is the difference between shipping
                in weeks instead of months.
              </p>

              <h3>Optimised costs</h3>
              <p>
                Less code means less manual work, fewer specialists required and lower maintenance costs. Teams
                reuse components, patterns and integrations instead of reinventing them each time.
              </p>

              <h3>Higher productivity</h3>
              <p>
                Developers can concentrate on business logic and UX rather than repetitive technical tasks.
                Business users can participate more actively in designing and refining workflows.
              </p>

              <h3>Flexibility and adaptability</h3>
              <p>
                Low-code platforms support iterative delivery and make it easier to respond to changing business
                requirements. New fields, processes or integrations can often be added without full refactoring.
              </p>

              <h3>Broader participation of users</h3>
              <p>
                Even specialists without a technical education can contribute to the creation of digital
                solutions — by configuring processes, forms and rules in a visual environment.
              </p>

              <h3>Better collaboration</h3>
              <p>
                Visual tools make communication between IT teams, designers and stakeholders clearer. Everyone
                can see how the process actually works instead of debating over abstract specifications.
              </p>

              <h3>Scalability and built-in support</h3>
              <p>
                Most platforms include monitoring, update and performance optimisation tools. This makes it
                easier to grow usage and add new modules over time.
              </p>

              <h3>Integration with existing systems</h3>
              <p>
                Low-code solutions can complement the organisation’s existing IT landscape instead of replacing
                it completely. New applications integrate with current databases, ERP, CRM or industry systems.
              </p>

              <h2>Limitations and Challenges of Low-Code</h2>
              <p>
                No technology is universal. Low-code also has its risks and trade-offs:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Complex customisation.</strong> For very specialised scenarios, manual coding and
                  custom extensions are still required.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Platform lock-in.</strong> Migrating to another ecosystem may be difficult if the
                  solution heavily depends on proprietary features.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Performance limitations.</strong> Very large data volumes or extremely complex
                  processes can require additional optimisation or even separate services.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Security and control.</strong> Not every platform provides deep control over data,
                  isolation and regulatory compliance out of the box.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How to Choose a Low-Code Platform</h2>
              <p>
                Before adopting a low-code solution, it is worth evaluating:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>the organisation’s functional needs and typical use cases,</li>
                <li>ease of use for both developers and business users,</li>
                <li>scalability, integration and performance capabilities,</li>
                <li>security features (encryption, access control, audit),</li>
                <li>total cost of ownership (licensing, operations, training).</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Future Trends in Low-Code</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>AI and machine learning.</strong> Built-in AI assistants will help design logic,
                  generate tests and optimise application performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Hybrid development models.</strong> Combining low-code, no-code and traditional
                  coding to balance speed and flexibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>IoT and mobile scenarios.</strong> Platforms will expand support for sensors,
                  devices and cross-platform mobile apps.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>DevOps and CI/CD integration.</strong> Low-code stacks will align better with
                  modern deployment, version control and team workflows.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Industry-specific solutions.</strong> More ready-made modules tailored for
                  healthcare, finance, manufacturing, education and the public sector.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Serverless architectures.</strong> Abstracting away infrastructure management so
                  teams can focus on logic and scaling products.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Security and compliance.</strong> Greater emphasis on data protection, certifications
                  and adherence to regulatory requirements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Market consolidation.</strong> Larger technology vendors will continue to acquire
                  smaller players, creating a more standardised low-code ecosystem.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                Low-code is not just “simplified development”. It is a <strong>catalyst of digital change</strong>
                that helps accelerate business processes, reduce costs and involve a broader group of people in
                creating innovation.
              </p>
              <p>
                For companies and public organisations, low-code is a chance to implement technological solutions
                faster, more affordably and more efficiently — without sacrificing quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a world where digital transformation is a necessity, low-code opens new horizons for growth,
                collaboration and continuous improvement.
