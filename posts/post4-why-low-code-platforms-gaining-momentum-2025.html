                Low-code platforms are moving from experimentation to mainstream adoption. This article explores
                how they differ from classic RAD, what drives their popularity and how they impact time-to-market,
                costs and organisational agility.

              <h2>Low-Code vs. RAD: What’s the Difference?</h2>
              <p>
                Low-code focuses on visually building applications with minimal manual coding, while still allowing
                developers to extend functionality with code where necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                RAD (Rapid Application Development) accelerates delivery through iterative prototyping, reusable
                components and close collaboration with users.
              </p>
              <p>
                In practice, low-code can be seen as a modern realisation of RAD principles — with stronger visual
                tooling, richer templates and built-in integration capabilities.
              </p>

              <h2>What Are Low-Code Platforms?</h2>
              <p>
                Low-code platforms address the problem of long development cycles. Routine tasks such as basic UI
                scaffolding, data modelling and integration wiring are handled by the platform itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users work in a visual environment (typically drag-and-drop), using pre-built components and
                templates. When needed, they can add complex custom logic using traditional code.
              </p>

              <h3>Key capabilities</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>visual design of UI, data models and workflows;</li>
                <li>pre-built components and connectors to external services;</li>
                <li>integrated testing, deployment and update tools;</li>
                <li>support for web, mobile and sometimes desktop applications.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Why Low-Code Is Gaining Popularity: Five Key Drivers</h2>

              <h3>1. Faster time-to-market</h3>
              <p>
                Organisations face constant pressure to release new features quickly. Automation of many steps in
                the delivery pipeline shortens the release cycle and reduces waiting time between ideas and
                production.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Lower development and maintenance costs</h3>
              <p>
                Reusable building blocks and visual tools reduce the need for large teams and lower the load on
                testing and integration efforts.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Customisation and scalability</h3>
              <p>
                Flexible frameworks allow solutions to be tailored to specific requirements and then expanded as
                the organisation grows, without rewriting from scratch.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Increased organisational agility</h3>
              <p>
                Real-time updates and iterative releases make it easier to respond quickly to user feedback and
                market changes.
              </p>

              <h3>5. Simplified UX design</h3>
              <p>
                Templates and UX guidelines help teams build usable interfaces faster, without deep involvement of
                dedicated design systems for every small project.
              </p>

              <h2>How Low-Code Accelerates Digital Transformation</h2>
              <p>
                Low-code platforms are designed for rapid assembly of business-specific solutions. Integrated
                development environments, visual logic editors and automated cloud deployment enable teams to
                deliver working tools much faster than with traditional stacks.
              </p>
              <p>
                In practice, this means:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>shorter timeframes for building internal tools and service apps,</li>
                <li>better coordination between business and IT teams,</li>
                <li>gradual replacement of legacy modules without “shutting down production”.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Current Low-Code Trends in 2025</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>AI and automation integration.</strong> Analytics, logic suggestions, auto-testing and
                  CI/CD support.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cross-platform delivery.</strong> A single stack for web and mobile apps, with
                  synchronised releases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Data-centric features.</strong> Easier connections to multiple databases, real-time
                  event processing and built-in analytics connectors.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Impact on Time-to-Market</h2>
              <p>
                Visual interfaces, drag-and-drop builders and ready-made modules reduce the number of manual steps
                in the delivery pipeline. Teams focus on core business logic and UX instead of infrastructure-level
                tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                This leads to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>faster iterations and releases,</li>
                <li>earlier user feedback,</li>
                <li>more frequent and consistent updates across platforms.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How Low-Code Reduces Enterprise Costs</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>lower need for large teams at the early stages of projects;</li>
                <li>reuse of components and templates across multiple solutions;</li>
                <li>lower infrastructure overhead via cloud deployment and automation;</li>
                <li>reduced “support debt” thanks to a standardised stack.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Agility as a Competitive Advantage</h2>
              <p>
                Low-code increases organisational agility. Changes in requirements, market conditions or design can
                be implemented in short cycles, with coordinated releases across web and mobile. This boosts
                competitiveness and improves user experience without heavy refactoring projects.
              </p>

              <h2>Tools and Frameworks</h2>
              <p>
                The market offers many platforms and JavaScript frameworks that combine low-code approaches with
                powerful UI components, form generators, data models, integrations and automated deployment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Choosing the right stack depends on:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>security and compliance requirements,</li>
                <li>integration needs,</li>
                <li>expected workload and scalability,</li>
                <li>licensing and total cost of ownership.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                In 2025, low-code is a mature toolbox that speeds up development, reduces costs and increases team
                flexibility. It does not eliminate the need for professional engineers — instead, it removes routine
                tasks, allowing them to focus on architecture and business value.
