                process works and why so many companies are moving in this direction.

              <h2>A New Stage in Software Development</h2>
              <p>
                The low-code development market reached <strong>$22.5 billion</strong> in 2022 and is expected to
                grow to almost <strong>$94 billion</strong> by 2028. Already, around <strong>60% of new applications</strong>
                are being created outside traditional IT departments, and according to Gartner, by 2026 over
                <strong>80% of developers</strong> will actively use low-code platforms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Companies like Canva are receiving billion-dollar investments thanks to tools that simplify business
                automation and make software development more accessible.
              </p>

              <h2>Low-code vs No-code: What’s the Difference?</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>No-code</strong> platforms allow users to create simple applications without writing any code at all.
                They are ideal for “citizen developers” — people without formal technical education. However, such
                platforms are limited when it comes to deep customisation, complex integrations or performance tuning.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Low-code</strong>, in contrast, combines a visual development environment (drag-and-drop, wizards,
                templates) with the ability to extend and customise behaviour using code. This makes low-code useful
                both for non-technical users and for experienced engineers who want to speed up delivery without losing
                flexibility.
              </p>

              <h2>How Low-code Development Works</h2>
              <p>
                Low-code does not replace programmers. Instead, it automates routine tasks and reduces the amount of
                boilerplate work, freeing engineers to focus on design, architecture and complex business logic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Compared to traditional development, low-code significantly reduces time-to-market and the volume of
                manual work required at each stage.
              </p>

              <h3>The typical low-code development lifecycle includes:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Defining system requirements and user scenarios</li>
                <li>Selecting third-party APIs and services</li>
                <li>Creating interfaces, data models and workflows using visual tools</li>
                <li>Integrating APIs and external systems</li>
                <li>Customising behaviour using code where necessary</li>
                <li>Testing and gathering user feedback</li>
                <li>Deploying to production (often via cloud pipelines)</li>
                <li>Ongoing maintenance and updates</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Traditional development usually requires more stages, more manual configuration and the involvement
                of a full development team at every step.
              </p>

              <h2>Key Advantages of Low-code Platforms</h2>

              <h3>1. Fast Results</h3>
              <p>
                Many low-code applications are delivered in less than <strong>three months</strong>. In traditional models,
                projects with similar scope can easily take from six months to a year. For startups and rapidly changing
                markets, this time difference can determine the success or failure of a product.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Easier Integration</h3>
              <p>
                Low-code solutions are designed to integrate with existing company systems — databases, ERP, CRM,
                authentication providers and more. Pre-built connectors and integration patterns reduce the load on IT
                teams and help keep operations stable.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Significant Cost Savings</h3>
              <p>
                Even when professional developers are involved, the time and effort required to build applications
                are noticeably reduced. Analysts report that <strong>ROI can exceed 200%</strong> for well-chosen
                low-code initiatives.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Access to Modern Technologies</h3>
              <p>
                Many low-code platforms are built on top of modern stacks: containers, microservices, cloud-native
                architectures. This allows companies to benefit from scalability and resilience without having to design
                everything from scratch.
              </p>

              <h3>5. Improved User Experience</h3>
              <p>
                Most platforms provide ready-made UI components and templates with intuitive navigation. This makes it
                easier to deliver consistent, user-friendly interfaces even when there is no dedicated UX team on the
                project.
              </p>

              <h2>What Applications Can Be Built with Low-code?</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Internal corporate solutions:</strong> task and project management, document workflows, resource
                  and personnel management systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Client-facing services:</strong> customer portals, loyalty programmes, self-service tools and
                  interactive applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Legacy system modernisation:</strong> updating ERP, CRM or HR platforms step by step, without
                  replacing the entire core at once.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>The Future of Low-code Development</h2>
              <p>
                Low-code is not just another method of building applications. It represents a broader shift in how
                organisations think about software: from scarce IT resources and long projects to collaborative,
                iterative and accessible development.
              </p>
              <p>
                It opens the door to the <strong>democratisation of technology</strong>, where people from different
                departments can actively participate in creating internal tools and automation scenarios.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the coming years, this trend is likely to strengthen. Businesses will continue to seek ways to deliver
                solutions faster, simpler and cheaper — and low-code development is exactly the kind of approach that
                supports this direction.
              </p>
